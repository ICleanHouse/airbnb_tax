> **Connections layer (apps.connections):** a `Connection` is a mutual host↔cleaner/agency
> relationship: one side requests, the other accepts (`pending → accepted`; also
> `declined`/`removed`). Only `accepted` connections may exchange `Message`s (polled
> in-app chat). Unique on `(requester, addressee)`. The `/shared/` endpoint derives the
> properties + cleanings the two have collaborated on from existing `Assignment`s — it
> stores no extra link. No payments.

## 2. State Machines

### 2a. User Account Status

```
                    ┌─────────┐
            signup  │         │
           ────────►│ pending │
                    │         │
                    └────┬────┘
                         │
            ┌────────────┼────────────┐
            ▼            ▼            ▼
       ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
       │ approved │ │ rejected │ │suspended │
       └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
            │                         ▲
            └─────────────────────────┘
                    (admin action)
```

**Rules:**
- `pending` users can log in and view dashboards but cannot post jobs, apply, or accept assignments.
- `approved` → `suspended` by admin action.
- `rejected` is terminal for marketplace access.
- A 6-digit email confirmation code is sent before account creation; final signup requires the verified token.
- Admin email is sent to all `role=admin` or `is_staff=True` users on every `pending` creation.
- Email confirmation sets `email_verified_at`; admin approval still controls marketplace rights.
- Public signup is a single React wizard at `/signup`; old signup step URLs redirect back to it.
- Cleaner signup payloads must include birth date, sex, native language, experience level, work preference, and at least one preferred time slot.
- Any changed signup field for Cleaner, Host, or Agency must be reflected in database fields, migrations, serializers, frontend payloads, and tests.

### 2b. Cleaner Verification Status

```
┌────────────┐   admin verifies   ┌──────────┐
│unverified  │──────────────────►│ verified  │
└────────────┘                    └──────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Cleaners must be `verified` AND `approved` before applying for any job.
- Verification UI in admin panel: **not yet built**.

### 2c. Cleaning Job Lifecycle

```
                   ┌───────┐
      host creates │       │
     ─────────────►│ draft │
                   │       │
                   └───┬───┘

                       ▼
                   ┌───────┐
                   │       │◄── cleaners apply
                   │ open  │
                   │       │
                   └───┬───┘
            ┌──────────┤
            │ cancelled│ assigned (host accepts application)
            ▼          ▼
       ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
       │cancelled │  │ assigned │
       └──────────┘  └────┬─────┘
                          │
               ┌──────────┼───────────┐
               │ completed│ disputed  │
               ▼          ▼           │
          ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐   │
          │completed │ │ disputed │◄──┘
          └──────────┘ └──────────┘
               │
               └──► reviews unlocked (both directions; double-blind reveal)
```

**Rules:**
- Only one `Assignment` per job (enforced at service layer).
- Only one job per property can exist for the exact same `scheduled_start` and `scheduled_end` (serializer validation plus database constraint).
- Competing applications are rejected when one is accepted.
- **Completion is a single step by the assigned cleaner (or an admin)** — there is no separate host confirmation. Marking done sets `completed_at` and flips the job to `completed` immediately; `cleaner_completed_at`/`host_completed_at` are both stamped at that moment. Cleaner completion is time-gated to after `scheduled_start`.
- Reviews only allowed after `completed` with `assignment.completed_at` set, and are **double-blind**: a review about a user is revealed only once both sides have reviewed that job, or after a 14-day window (`feedback.services.REVIEW_WINDOW_DAYS`). On completion both host and cleaner receive a `review.requested` prompt. For delegated agency assignments, the review parties are the host and the actual assigned cleaner member; the agency account is not a review participant after delegation.
- `disputed` requires admin inspection (not yet built).

### 2d. Cleaner Application Lifecycle

```
              ┌─────────┐
  cleaner     │         │
  applies ───►│ pending │
              │         │
              └────┬────┘
                   │
       ┌───────────┼───────────┐
       ▼           ▼           ▼
  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
  │ accepted │ │ rejected │ │withdrawn │
  └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
       │
       └──► Assignment created
            Other applications → rejected
```

### 2e. Agency Invitation & Membership

```
Agency Invitation:
  pending ──► accepted ──► [AgencyMembership: pending → active]
           └► expired / declined

Agency Membership:
  active ──► revoked   (admin or agency action)
```

**Rules:**
- Agency can assign work only to `active` members.
- Member cleaner must also be `approved` + `verified` to receive agency work.
- Once an accepted agency assignment is delegated to a member cleaner, the normal agency API treats that delegation as immutable. Repeating the same member assignment is idempotent; assigning a different member is rejected. Any future reassignment requires a separate admin/support workflow.
- Cleaner application acceptance, direct-offer acceptance, and concrete agency
  member delegation lock the worker and reject any non-cancelled assignment
  satisfying `existing_start < candidate_end` and
  `existing_end > candidate_start`. Direct assignments use
  `Assignment.cleaner`; delegated agency work uses
  `Assignment.assigned_member`. Completed assignments still participate by
  their scheduled interval, while `Assignment.cancelled_at` releases it.
- Agency application acceptance creates the one assignment for the job without
  treating the agency account as an occupied cleaner. The schedule check begins
  only when a concrete member is delegated.
- Future assigned-job reschedule and emergency-replacement acceptance services
  must acquire the same concrete-worker lock and invoke the same overlap check
  inside their mutation transaction.

### 2f. Favourite Cleaners

**Rules:**
- Hosts can create favourites only for public marketplace-eligible cleaners: role `cleaner`, active user, approved account, existing cleaner profile, and `verification_status="verified"`.
- Favourite creation rejects pending, rejected, suspended, inactive, unverified, missing-profile, host, agency, and admin targets.
- Duplicate favourite creation is idempotent and keeps one row per `(host, cleaner)`.
- Historical favourites are not deleted when a cleaner later becomes unavailable. The authenticated host's favourite list keeps showing the historical row through the existing safe favourite serializer fields; new favourites for that unavailable cleaner are rejected.

## 3. Module Dependency Graph

Backend apps in `backend/apps/`. Arrows = "imports models/services from".

```
notifications ◄─────────── accounts
      ▲
      │
   accounts ◄───────────── properties
      ▲                         ▲
      │                         │
   marketplace ◄────────────────┘
      ▲
      │
   calendars ◄──────────── properties
                ◄──────────── marketplace

   feedback ◄────────────── accounts
            ◄────────────── marketplace
```

**Hard rules:**
- No app imports from an app to its right in the dependency chain.
- `accounts` has zero imports from other domain apps.
- `notifications` may import `accounts` (to look up admin emails) but nothing else.
- Cross-domain workflows use explicit service functions — never reach into another app's ORM directly from a view.

### Config layer (`backend/config/`)

```
settings.py ──► loaded by all apps at startup
celery.py   ──► wires Celery to Django settings
settings.py ──► calls load_dotenv() during settings import
manage.py   ──► calls load_dotenv() before Django setup
wsgi.py     ──► calls load_dotenv() before Django setup
asgi.py     ──► calls load_dotenv() before Django setup
```

## 4. Frontend Route Graph

Each route node lists: auth requirement, role gate, data sources (API calls), and write actions.

```

            recovery persists only version, savedAt, role, citySlug,
            selectedZoneIds, and experienceLevel for 24 hours
  secrets: passwords, confirmation, email/code/token, identity/profile fields,
           errors, and responses remain in React memory only and are empty after refresh
  progress starts: account step
  cleaner path: account → confirm email → role → personal info → location → native language → experience → introduction → profile photo → /app
  host/agency path: account → confirm email → role → location → /app
  old step URLs: /signup/confirm-email, /signup/role, /signup/location,
                 /signup/personal-info, /signup/native-language, /signup/experience
                 redirect to /signup

          DELETE /api/properties/images/{id}/                 (remove photo)
          POST   /api/properties/parse-ics/                   (ICS upload → parsed events)
          POST   /api/marketplace/jobs/                       (post job / ICS bulk create)
          POST   /api/marketplace/jobs/{id}/publish/          (draft → open)
          DELETE /api/marketplace/jobs/{id}/                  (delete; draft/open only)
          POST   /api/marketplace/applications/{id}/accept/   (accept → creates assignment)
          POST   /api/marketplace/applications/{id}/reject/   (decline application)
          POST   /api/feedback/reviews/                       (review cleaner via ReviewModal; body: job_id, reviewee_id)
  notes:
    - Host no longer marks/confirms completion — the cleaner does. Host's role post-completion is to review.
    - A review.requested notification deep-links here via ?reviewJob=<id>, opening ReviewModal (double-blind two-way window)
    - Job form uses separate date + start/end time fields (not datetime-local)
    - Summary cards are <button> elements driving appFilter state (pending/active/completed/open)
    - hostRatingAvg = avg of reviews where reviewee === me.id (cleaner-written reviews of the host; revealed only)

/cleaner                         [role: cleaner only]
  reads: GET /api/accounts/me/
         GET /api/accounts/cleaners/

          POST /api/marketplace/applications/
          POST /api/marketplace/jobs/{id}/complete/           (mark done — single-step completion)
          POST /api/feedback/reviews/                         (review host via ReviewModal; body: job_id, reviewee_id)
  notes:
    - Cleaner marking done completes the job outright (no host confirm); a review.requested
      notification deep-links via ?reviewJob=<id> into the ReviewModal double-blind window

/agency   [NOT BUILT]             [role: agency only]
  planned reads: GET /api/accounts/me/
                 GET /api/accounts/agency-memberships/

| GET/POST/DELETE | `/api/marketplace/favourites/` | Host | ✅ — create targets public-eligible cleaners only; historical rows remain visible to owner |

Marketplace disclosure tiers are server-enforced. Anonymous demand contains
only canonical city/zone IDs and names plus aggregate counts. Approved verified
cleaners and eligible approved agencies receive only the S1-D04 evaluator
allowlist (job ID, canonical location, exact schedule, proposed price/currency,
bedrooms, square metres, status, and `can_apply`). Active assigned participants
add only the minimum operational property/address/instructions/agreed-price,
workflow/display fields, and protected primary image. Completed or otherwise
retained worker records use the `history` tier: evaluator fields plus host
display, agreed price, and assignment history, but no property name/address,
image, or instructions. Coordinates remain private in every worker tier.

### Connections (apps.connections — LinkedIn-style relationship + polled in-app chat)

| Method | Route | Auth | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/connections/` | Required | ✅ — my accepted + incoming/outgoing pending |
| POST | `/api/connections/` (body: `user_id`) | Host/Cleaner | ✅ — send request (host↔cleaner only) |
| POST | `/api/connections/{id}/accept/` | Addressee | ✅ |
| POST | `/api/connections/{id}/decline/` | Addressee | ✅ |
| DELETE | `/api/connections/{id}/` | Participant | ✅ — remove |
| GET/POST | `/api/connections/{id}/messages/` | Participant | ✅ — GET marks read; POST sends (accepted only) |
| POST | `/api/connections/{id}/read/` | Participant | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/connections/unread-count/` | Required | ✅ — `{ unread, pending_requests }` |
| GET | `/api/connections/{id}/shared/` | Accepted connection; active/approved requester; worker requester also evaluator-eligible | ✅ — no-store current-assignment allowlist only |

The shared-work response contains property `name`, `city`, and `cleanings`
count plus cleaning `job_id`, `property_name`, `scheduled_start`, `status`,
`agreed_price`, and `currency`. It excludes address, image, instructions,
coordinates, host identity, and free text, and never includes cancelled or
completed assignments.

### Other

| Method | Route | Auth | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/api/feedback/reviews/` | Required | ✅ — two-way, double-blind. POST body: `job_id`, `reviewee_id`, `rating`, `comment`. GET returns own reviews + received reviews only once revealed (both submitted, or 14-day window closed) |

**Local fallback:** When `celery` is not installed, `_FakeTask` in `apps/notifications/tasks.py` wraps every task and executes it synchronously. `.delay()` and `.apply()` are both supported. `bind=True` tasks receive a `_FakeTaskSelf` stub with `.retry()`.

## 7. Data Model Summary

Key fields only. Full schema lives in migrations.

### User
```
id, email, phone_number, first_name, last_name,
role: [host | cleaner | agency | admin],
account_status: [pending | approved | rejected | suspended],
is_active, is_staff,
approved_at, approved_by, email_verified_at,
language_preference: [bg | en]
```

### CleanerProfile
```
user (1:1), kind, display_name, bio, city, service_areas[],
verification_status: [pending | verified | rejected | suspended],
sex: [male | female | prefer_not_to_say],
birth_date, age (calculated), native_language, experience_level,
education, has_driving_license, driving_license_categories[],
has_own_car, smoker,
profile_image, average_rating, completed_jobs_count
```

Cleaner signup rules:
- Birth date is required and must prove age 18+.
- Sex, native language, and experience level are required.
- The frontend shows birth date as a compact dropdown calendar.

Signup database rule:
- Final Cleaner, Host, and Agency signup questions must have matching database columns/JSON fields, migrations, serializer validation, profile serializer exposure, frontend payload handling, and tests.

### City / ServiceZone / ServiceZoneGeometry
```
City:
slug, name_bg, name_en, country_code, is_active

ServiceZone:
city (FK), slug, name_bg, name_en, legacy_names[], is_active

ServiceZoneGeometry:
service_zone (1:1), geometry (GeoJSON), source, updated_at
```

Sofia location rules:
- The canonical catalog contains 144 exact ID/name pairs from `districits_sofia/sofia_districts_ready.geojson`.
- Sofia zone slugs are stable `osm-N` values, producing IDs such as `sofia:osm-1`.
- Canonical names preserve prefixes such as `кв.` and `ж.к.`; Sofia `legacy_names` remain empty.
- `frontend/lib/sofiaDistricts.ts` and `frontend/public/maps/sofia/districts.geojson` must stay identical to the canonical source.

### AgencyProfile
```
user (1:1), company_name, service_areas[],
member_count (computed), bio
```

### Property
```
host (FK→HostProfile), name, address, city, country,
service_zone (nullable FK→ServiceZone; required for new/relocated Sofia properties),
timezone (default: Europe/Sofia),
default_cleaning_duration_minutes, default_price_eur,
cleaning_instructions, access_notes
```

Operational `PropertyImage` files are private. API serializers expose a protected
`/api/properties/images/{id}/content/` URL, never a raw storage path. Owners and
admins may read owned images; active approved/verified assigned participants may
read only the primary image for a current non-cancelled assignment. Every raw
`/media/*` route returns 404. Approved public cleaner profile media remains the
public `profile_image` API/data value and is not `PropertyImage` raw storage.

### CleaningJob
```
property (FK), title, description,
scheduled_start (datetime UTC), scheduled_end (datetime UTC),
status: [draft | open | assigned | completed | cancelled | disputed],
price_eur, published_at,
batch (FK→CleaningBatch, nullable),
source: [manual | ics_import | batch]
```

Uniqueness rule:
- `(property, scheduled_start, scheduled_end)` must be unique.

### CleanerApplication
```
job (FK), cleaner (FK→CleanerProfile, nullable),
agency (FK→AgencyProfile, nullable),
proposed_price_eur, message,
status: [pending | accepted | rejected | withdrawn],
submitted_at
```

### Assignment
```
job (1:1), application (FK), cleaner (FK→User),
assigned_member (FK→User, nullable),
assigned_at, host_completed_at, cleaner_completed_at,
completed_at, cancelled_at
```

### Review
```
job (FK), reviewer (FK→User), reviewee (FK→User),
rating (1–5), comment,
private_note, is_private_issue, created_at
```
Visibility (double-blind):
- A review about a user is revealed only when the counterpart public review for the same job exists, OR `assignment.completed_at` is older than `REVIEW_WINDOW_DAYS` (14). The submission window is inclusive at the exact 14-day deadline and closes immediately after it.
- `is_private_issue=True` reports are admin/internal only: they are hidden from normal review lists and public cleaner profiles, normal serializers do not expose `private_note` or `is_private_issue`, and they do not create public-review prompt/unlock notifications.
- `CleanerProfile.average_rating` / `completed_jobs_count` are recomputed from revealed reviews only.

### Notification
```
user (FK), channel: [in_app | email | sms],
type, title, body,
read_at, sent_at, created_at
```

### AuditLog
```
actor (FK→User), action, entity_type, entity_id,
metadata (JSON), created_at
```

### Environment resolution order

```
Shell environment variables    (highest priority)
        │  override=False
        ▼
.env file (python-dotenv)
        │
        ▼
Django settings.py defaults    (lowest priority)
```

`DATABASE_URL` must be **absent or commented out** in local `.env`.
Docker passes it via `env_file:` with the `db` hostname valid inside the container network.

## 10. Critical Rules Index

Rules that must never be broken regardless of task scope.

| # | Rule | Where enforced |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | A job has at most one accepted `Assignment` | Service layer — `marketplace/services.py` |
| R2 | Reviews only after job `completed`; two-way and double-blind (received reviews revealed only when both submit or the 14-day window closes; ratings count revealed reviews only) | `feedback/services.py` + `ReviewViewSet.get_queryset` |
| R3 | Cleaners must be `verified` + `approved` before applying | Permission class in marketplace views |
| R4 | Agencies assign only to `active` members, and normal agency delegation is immutable after the first member assignment | Service layer — agency delegation |
| R5 | No payment processing in v1 | Architecture constraint |
| R6 | Internal calendar is source of truth | Calendar module owns conflict detection |
| R7 | Never set `Content-Type` for FormData | `frontend/lib/api.ts` — typeof body check |
| R8 | Never call `fetch` directly — use `apiFetch` | Frontend convention |
| R9 | Never commit `.env` | `.gitignore` |
| R10 | `trailingSlash: true` + dual API rewrite — do not simplify | `frontend/next.config.mjs` |
| R11 | `.env` is loaded for local manual runs; shell env wins where `override=False` is used | `settings.py`, `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py` |
| R12 | `DATABASE_URL` commented out in local `.env` | `.env` (Docker hostname `db` is invalid locally) |
| R13 | All Celery tasks must be idempotent and retryable | `apps/notifications/tasks.py` convention |
| R14 | Public `/` is marketing only — never a dashboard | Frontend routing |
| R15 | Timezone `Europe/Sofia`; store UTC, display local | All datetime handling |
| R16 | Signup field changes must update database models, migrations, serializers, frontend payloads, and tests together | Accounts signup/profile workflow |
| R17 | A property cannot have two jobs for the exact same start/end time | `CleaningJob` unique constraint + serializer validation |
| R18 | Job completion is a single step by the assigned cleaner (or admin) after `scheduled_start` — there is no host confirmation step | `marketplace/services.py` + dashboard guards |
| R19 | Favourites can be created only for public marketplace-eligible cleaners; historical unavailable favourites remain visible to the owning host through safe serializer fields | `accounts.models` eligibility helper + `marketplace/services.py` |
| R20 | All new user-facing strings must ship with both `en.json` and `bg.json` values; keys are English camelCase; values only differ between files | `frontend/messages/` — next-intl v4 |
| R21 | Never use hardcoded UI strings in components — always use `useTranslations` from next-intl | Frontend convention; module-level functions with strings must move inside the component |
| R22 | One concrete cleaner cannot hold overlapping non-cancelled assignments; intervals are half-open and completed work remains interval-authoritative | `marketplace/services.py` worker row lock + assignment overlap query |
